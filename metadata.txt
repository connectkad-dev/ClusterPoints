name=ClusterPoints
qgisMinimumVersion=3.6
description=Cluster Points conducts spatial clustering of points based on their mutual distance to each other. The user can select between the K-Means algorithm and (agglomerative) hierarchical clustering with several different link functions.
version=3.7
author=Johannes Jenkner
email=jjenkner@web.de

about=Sometimes it is requisite to determine distinct groups of points on a map which are closest to each other. To automatize this process, Cluster Points allows you to find a predefined number of groups with mutually close points. <br><br>The cluster algorithms are well-known, but until now there has not been a comprehensive implementation for a GIS system, yet. This plugin was started during the project phase of a GIS-Analyst training course in Berlin (https://gis-trainer.de).
